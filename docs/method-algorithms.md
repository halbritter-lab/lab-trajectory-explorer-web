## Theil-Sen (2026-09-23)

Inputs are dated numeric observations, sorted without mutating caller data. Time
is elapsed UTC milliseconds from the earliest date divided by 365.25 days/year.
At least three observations and two distinct timestamps are required. Retain
repeated-date observations but omit pairs whose time difference is zero.

The slope is the median of `(y[j]-y[i])/(x[j]-x[i])` over pairs with increasing
time. The intercept is `median(y) - slope * median(x)`. R² is unavailable.
For x=[0,1,2,3], y=[0,0,4,9], slope=3.5 and intercept=-3.25; the former web
median-residual convention produced -2.25 and has intentionally been replaced.

Slope confidence bounds follow the Python reference's SciPy `theilslopes`
default 95% convention. Let n be observation count and N the number of valid
pair slopes. For each repeated time or value group of size k, subtract
`k*(k-1)*(2*k+5)` from `n*(n-1)*(2*n+5)`; divide the result by 18 to obtain V.
With C=1.959963984540054*sqrt(V), use zero-based sorted-slope ranks
`max(roundEven((N-C)/2)-1,0)` and `min(roundEven((N+C)/2),N-1)`.
Exact half-integers round to even to match NumPy. Undefined variance/ranks
produce unavailable bounds. These are slope bounds, not confidence bounds for
the intercept or prediction intervals for individual future observations.

The kernel expects valid numeric points from preparation. The minimum applies
to the actual prepared observations when used for a display fit. All pairs are
enumerated, so time and temporary storage grow quadratically with point count.
