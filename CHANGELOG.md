# Changelog

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) while its public
interfaces are still evolving before 1.0.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Visible slope-quality warnings and explicit reasons when no CKD G5 projection
  is available.
- Canonical camelCase import headers with backward-compatible aliases, broader
  sex-value parsing, and downloadable empty templates.
- Fit-estimator and unstable-slope metadata in cohort and patient exports.
- Pull-request CI and browser regression coverage for the new import, quality,
  endpoint, download, and mobile methodology paths.

### Fixed

- Reliability checks now use the measurements and span retained after
  censoring, exclusions, and time balancing without changing reference-parity
  reason codes.
- Exported fit-model metadata now identifies the estimator that produced the
  scalar slope.
- Ambiguous recognized import headers are rejected without rejecting harmless
  collisions among unrelated metadata columns.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

- Initial deployed baseline.
